# ESP8266 Huzzah Breakout Case / Enclosure

Case / Enclosure for the ESP8266 Huzzah breakout board (non-Feather) manufactured by Adafruit.

# Details

Intended for use with male headers soldered top-side. Try using the asterisk to organize wire.

### Printing notes

This case was designed around a 0.48mm extrusion width. This gives the features on the case a bit of added strength. If the case isn't printing quite right, try adjusting the slicer's extrusion width.

### Buttons

The two buttons are held in by a toe-like lip (so if the case gets flipped upside down the buttons don't go flying everywhere(!)). To insert them, put the toe in first and press it in at an angle. Depending on your print a bit of filing or cutting may make insertion easier!

### Dust covers

There are two covers to keep things somewhat clean. Both are press-fit, with the asterisk cover having a looser/thinner fit. They're optional and are included in the 'everything' plate, as well as separately.
